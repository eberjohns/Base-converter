# Base Converter

Python code for converting a number from & to any base. Eg:

**INPUT**
> Input number to convert: 32

> Input base of this number: 10 

> Input base to convert to: 16 

**OUTPUT**
> 20

## Aim:

This should support the conversion of any base like 17, 23 or any other you could think of... so the symbols can be extended to **ASCII** characters.

Finally integrate into a website.
